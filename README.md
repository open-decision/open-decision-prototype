## Set-up

The instructions down below will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to install Python and the package manager PIP. When you install Python <= 3.4 from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/), PIP is already installed.

```
# Install virtual enviroment
pip install virtualenv
```

### Installation

First set-up and start the virtual environment.

```
# Create virtualenv
virtualenv -p python3 od

# Start environment
source od/bin/activate

```

Now clone the repo to the "src"-folder or download the [repo](https://github.com/fbennets/open-decision) as zip, unpack the folder, move it into the folder of your environment and rename it to "src".

```
# Clone repository to current directory
cd od
git clone https://github.com/fbennets/open-decision.git src

```
Next install the requirements.

```
# Install dependencies
cd src
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Now start the Django development server and enjoy!

```
# Start the development server
python manage.py runserver
```
Access the server at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) or [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

Now you can create an account and start playing around or use the demo-account to get a first impression:

```
User: Testperson
Password: Mustermann1
```
